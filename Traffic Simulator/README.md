Traffic Simulator --- Networking Made Simple
==========================================
##The Problem
-------------
- Gap: Networking ideas like hops, latency, and routing can be hard to picture.
- Result: Students and beginners often struggle to connect theory with what actually happens to packets.
##The Solution
---------------
Tool: A tiny traffic simulator that runs in your browser (or locally) to simulate packet hops.
Approach: Visual + code example makes abstract concepts concrete: you can see how packets travel, where they wait, and how delays add up.

 What This Helps With
-----------------------
-   Learning: Understand hops, latency, queuing, and simple routing.
-   Experimenting: Tweak values (delay, number of hops, packet rate) and see effects instantly.

 How It Works
---------------
-   Model: The simulator models a path of nodes (hops). Each packet moves from node to node.
-   Timing: Each hop adds a delay; packets may queue if a node is busy.
-   Visualization: `main.html` shows the simulation; `hop_simulator.js` contains the simulation logic.
-   Flow: On "start", packets are created and step through hops until they reach the end or drop (if implemented).
-   Traffic Routing: The simulator distinguishes between local and external traffic based on destination IP addresses, demonstrating how networks route packets differently for internal vs. external destinations.


 Quick Start
--------------

1.  Open in browser: Double-click `main.html` or open it from your browser.
2.  Run a simple local server (recommended):
    bash

    python -m http.server 8000

    Then open `http://localhost:8000/main.html` in your browser.

 Try It
---------

-   What to change: Edit delay, hop count, or packet rate in `hop_simulator.js` to see different behaviors.

-   Suggested experiments: Increase packet rate to see queuing; increase hop delays to see larger end-to-end latency.

⚠️ Limitations
--------------

-   Simple model: Not a production network tool --- it's educational.

-   No real routing: It simulates a fixed path rather than full routing protocols.

-   Extensible: Can be expanded with packet loss, multiple paths, or visual stats.
